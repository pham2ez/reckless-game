## Accessibility to color-blind people
I downloaded the Google Chrome extension that allows developers to view what their website might look like for a colorblinded person for my version of Fritter. In A4, I wanted to make the colors of the follow/unfollow and upvote/unupvote buttons toggle so that it was generally easier for users to differentiate if the request went through to the server. However, through using the extension, I was able to see that the colors I employed was sometimes hard to differentiate for a red-green colorblind person. In the end, I kept the colors mostly warm for the theme of the freets and changed the colors of the follow/unfollow and upvote/unupvote buttons so that they could still be differentiated for colorblind people.

## Designing for hard of seeing people
All of the text fonts are at least 18px so that it is easier for people who are hard of seeing to use the app. Also, in order to make it easier for users in general, the sections are separated in a way such that the purposes are clear. For example, the colors help differentiate different freets and all contents of the freets are on the right so that it isn't hindered by the view of the buttons (making it possible for users to view freets faster).

## One-Handed Usability
The decision to design all of the buttons to be easily accessible on the right side makes it faster for people to perform actions with minimal cursor movement. However, I believe that this does hinder people who are more used to the left side of the screen, but the majority of the population are right-handed people. If I were to have more time, I would create an option in the settings to adjust the website view.

In addition, since everything is more concentrated in the top right hand side of the website, buttons that signs the user out, deletes the user's post and account are on the left and bottom areas of the screen since these actions are used less in practice (and could possibly be unwanted in fear of accidentally deleting a post/signing out).

## Error Handling
All errors and successes are always viewable at the top of the screen and are always human friendly, concise, and clear. And stays for a long time (10 seconds), as long as having the option of disappearing faster, depending if the user wants to close the message faster.

## Multiple Search Types
This makes it so that it is easier for users to find what they want by breaking down the search into finding a certain freet ID, all of a user's freets, and then a user to make it easy to follow them. One thing that should be added is the functionality to view all users with that substring/beginning with the substring so that more users would show up.

## Reflection
I believe that the way that I implemented the wireframe is cogniscent of issues such as knowing when a freet is edited, deleted, and also when a freet is actually a response to another freet. It is also cogniscent of users that do make mistakes through the design and focuses on making the site easy to understand even for a child, which might cause children to become addicted as discussed in A4's reflection.
Although my api has the ability for users to see all of the refreets of the refreets (and etc.), it is not directly implemented, but it is still possible to go up the chain and find the original freet.
This design implements the downfalls found in the wireframe and as well as maximizes as many good heuristics as possible. Since I believed that seeing who upvoted what posts would have a positive impact on users, I also implemented it in the final design of Fritter.
